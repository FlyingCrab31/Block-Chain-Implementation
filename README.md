# Block-Chain-Implementation
# Simple Blockchain Implementation in C

This is a simple blockchain implementation in C. It allows users to add blocks to the blockchain and view the entire blockchain.

## Features

- Add blocks to the blockchain
- View the entire blockchain

## Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- OpenSSL library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

https://github.com/FlyingCrab31/Block-Chain-Implementation.git

2. Compile the source files:

cd BlockChain-c
gcc -o BlockChain BlockChain.c -lcrypto

3. Run the executable:

./BlockChain

## Usage

Once the program is running, you will see a menu with the following options:

1. Add a Block
2. Print Blockchain
3. Exit

- To add a block, choose option 1. The program will add a new block to the blockchain.
- To view the entire blockchain, choose option 2. The program will display all the blocks in the blockchain.
- To exit the program, choose option 3.
